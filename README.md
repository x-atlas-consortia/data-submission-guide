# Data Submission Guide
A documentation site for the Data Submission Guide used by both HuBMAP and SenNet

The Markdown (MD) files in this repo consist of sections in the Data Submission Guide (DSG), a resource for data submitters in the HuBMAP and SenNet Consortia.
The files are syncronized via GitHub Actions to both the SenNet (https://docs.sennetconsortium.org/data-submission) and HuBMAP documentation (https://docs.hubmapconsortium.org/data-submission) sites which are hosted by GitHub Pages via repos https://github.com/sennetconsortium/documentation and https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/documentation respectively. 

Updating and maintaining this content is simply a matter of updating the relevant MD file(s), PR/merge into main as changes are needed, and GitHub will automatically distribute the changes to the dependent documentation sites.

## Section 9 - Data Upload

#### Submitting Donor or Source Data

_Prerequisite:_ Your submission donors / sources and samples have already been registered. <br> **NOTE:** Donor / source privacy is a top priority when HuBMAP and SenNet receive data from the community.

1. For tracking purpose email the <a href="mailto:help@hubmapconsortium.org">HuBMAP Helpdesk</a> OR <a href="mailto:help@sennetconsortium.org">SenNet Helpdesk</a> to create a Helpdesk ticket.
   1. Request donor (or source) directory:
      - HuBMAP - The HIVE creates a <a href="https://app.globus.org/groups">Globus</a> directory for your donor information.
      - SenNet - The CODCC creates a <a href="https://app.globus.org/groups">Globus</a> directory for your source information.
    2. Email notification: You will receive an email when the directory is ready. The email will state:
         - "Please upload HuBMAP donor (or SenNet source) data only here 
         - This site is HIPAA protected. If de-identification errors are made we will correct them.
         - Please associate all content with the applicable donor HuBMAP ID (or source SenNet ID)
         - Those are of the format: HBM111.XXXX.111 (or SNT111.YYYY.222)...”
  2. Upload donor (or source) data. This is clinical information matched to the correct HuBMAP (or SenNet) IDs.
      - Once all of the data has been uploaded, reply to the original Helpdesk email / ticket.
     1. HIVE / CODCC processing: The HIVE (or CODCC) begins processing your donor (or source) data to ensure capture of as much data as possible for potential querying by scientists.
     2. Upload via Globus endpoint: For better performance and support, given the size of donor or source data files.

  3. **Complete onboarding for your consortium.**
      - Register as a HuBMAP or SenNet member.
      - Verify that you can successfully login to the <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.org/"> HuBMAP Consortium</a> or <a href="https://sennetconsortium.org/"> SenNet Consortium</a> website.

  _Register experimental protocols for your group:_
        
  4. **Register experimental protocol(s)** via <a href="https://www.protocols.io/welcome">protocols.io</a>. **Note:** _Each_ registered protocol requires a digital object identifier (DOI).
     - **Initial setup**
         - Select a lead and create accounts.
         - Create a workspace for your team (TMC, TTD, RTI, DP, etc).
      - **Organize your protocols**
          - Break workflows into modules.
          - Create an overall protocol that references others.
          - See this Vanderbilt protocol as an example: <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bfskjncw">VU BIOMIC Kidney pipeline</a>
      - **Create / Publish a New protocol**
          - Use a template, many templates are available.
          - Include HuBMAP (or SenNet) and team name as keywords.
          - Publish the protocol.
          - Pick the DOI option when publishing.
          - For additional examples, see also:
            - <a href="https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/human-biomolecular-atlas-program-hubmap-method-development">HuBMAP Method Development Community</a>
            - <a href="https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/cellular-senescence-network-sennet-method-develo">SenNet Method Development Community</a>
       - **Modify an existing protocol**
          - Open an existing protocol.
          - Use _Edit New Version_ or _Edit New Fork_.
          - For detailed directions, click on _"Details about Creating (or Publishing) Protocols..."_ or related sections below.

**Note:** There are three different types of protocols required. **Case selection protocols** describe the inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to donors/sources in the study. You will be prompted to provide a case selection protocol DOI at source/sample registration. **Sample preparation protocols** outline a lab's procedure to derive a tissue sample from a donor/source. You will be prompted to provide a sample preparation protocol DOI at organ, tissue block, tissue section, and tissue suspension registration. **Assay preparation protocols** describe how an experiment for a specific modality is carried out. The assay preparation protocol DOI should be included in the assay metadata TSV file.
 
### Different ways to create a New Protocol

1. Create an entirely new protocol from "scratch" at [protocols.io](http://protocols.io/).
2. Create a new version of an existing protocol:
    - Based on an existing protocol that you created.
    - Based on an existing protocol that _someone else_ created.

<summary>Details about Creating New Protocols</summary>

<h3 id="Create-New-Protocol">Creating an entirely new protocol (from "scratch"):</h3>

1. **Log into protocols.io** Using your protocols.io login registered with your consortium.
2. **Select your Workspace:**
   - Click the HuBMAP icon for the HuBMAP Workspace
   - Click the SenNet icon for the SenNet Workspace
   - If you do not see your icon you have not been added to the group - Contact your helpdesk for assistance.
3. **Click the NEW + button** at the top and select **New protocol**.
4. **Select a template option:**
   - There are several template options for a protocol.
   - The option selected determines the tool widgets shown on the right.
5. **Rename the protocol** from “untitled protocol” to something more descriptive so the protocol saves properly.
6. **Fill in the Details:** A series of tabs displays under the protocol title: (_Description, Guidelines..., Materials, etc._)
   - Fill in information for all tabs shown
   - Under _Description > Keywords_ enter your consortium and group (TMC, etc.)
7. **Publishing** - When you are satisfied that the protocol is complete...
   - Select **MORE > Publish**
   - Publishing is a multistep process (see below).

**IMPORTANT:** Once published, a protocol cannot be deleted or edited, only versioned.

<summary>Details about Publishing Protocols</summary>

### Publishing your new protocol:

1. **Publish type** - select **With DOI**. <br> **IMPORTANT:** HuBMAP and SenNet protocols MUST be assigned a DOI.
    - This is required to register a donor (or source) and samples.
    - This is required to submit assay metadata to the HIVE or CODCC.
2. **Set authors** - Multiple authors may be added in order of importance.
   - You can drag-and-drop authors to reorder.
3. **Status** - Select _Working, In Development,_ or _Other_.
4. **Research study** - Select _Research_ (most likely) or _Non-Research_.
5. **Add workspaces** - _Show_ and _Share_ the protocol on the HuBMAP (or SenNet) Workspace.
   - You can also show or share the protocol on any other workspace, if desired.
6. **Publish** - Publish the protocol.

## Section 9 - Clinical Human Metadata

**Submitting Donor or Source Data**

To upload your data, request that the applicable Helpdesk set up a Globus directory. Next upload your data for HIVE or CODCC processing.
_Prerequisite:_ Your submission donors / sources and samples have already been registered. **NOTE:** Donor / source privacy is a top priority when HuBMAP and SenNet receive data from the community. Please do not send any clinical human metadata directly to the Data Curation team or to a consortium help desk. Data providers *must* use the secure Globus directory described below.

1. **Email the <a href="mailto:help@hubmapconsortium.org">HuBMAP Helpdesk</a> OR <a href="mailto:help@sennetconsortium.org">SenNet Helpdesk</a> to create a Helpdesk ticket** (for tracking purposes).
   - **Request donor (or source) directory:**
      - HuBMAP - The HIVE creates a <a href="https://app.globus.org/groups">Globus</a> directory for your donor information.
      - SenNet - The CODCC creates a <a href="https://app.globus.org/groups">Globus</a> directory for your source information.
   - **Email notification:** You will receive an email when the directory is ready. The email will state:
      - "Please upload HuBMAP donor (or SenNet source) data only here
      - This site is HIPAA protected. If de-identification errors are made we will correct them.
      - Please associate all content with the applicable donor HuBMAP ID (or source SenNet ID)
      - Those are of the format: HBM111.XXXX.111 (or SNT111.YYYY.222)...‚Äù
  2. **Upload donor (or source) data.** This is clinical information matched to the correct HuBMAP (or SenNet) IDs.
      - Once all of the data has been uploaded, reply to the original Helpdesk email / ticket.
      - **HIVE / CODCC processing:** The HIVE (or CODCC) begins processing your donor (or source) data to ensure capture of as much data as possible for potential querying by scientists.
      - **Upload via Globus endpoint:** For better performance and support, given the size of donor or source data files. 

See the **Globus FAQ** regarding **<a href="https://docs.globus.org/faq/globus-connect-endpoints/"> Globus Connect and Endpoints</a>**, see also **<a href="https://hubmapconsortium.org/policies/"> HuBMAP's data-related policies</a>**, or **<a href="https://sennetconsortium.org/external-data-use/"> SenNet's Data Sharing policy</a>**. Contact the **<a href="mailto:help@hubmapconsortium.org">HuBMAP Helpdesk</a>** OR **<a href="mailto:help@sennetconsortium.org">SenNet Helpdesk</a>** with any additional questions.
